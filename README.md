# Text Classification & Text Mining on Twenty Newsgroups Dataset

## Overview

This project applies text classification and text mining techniques on the Twenty Newsgroups dataset. The dataset consists of newsgroup posts categorized into 20 different topics, making it a popular benchmark for text analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Features
(1) Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.

(2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Word frequency analysis, word cloud visualization.

(3) Text Classification: Implementation of various machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

(4) Pattern-based Augmentation: Common text patterns are incorporated as variables to generate augmented data, leading to improved classification performance.

(5) Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization.

## Results
Model performance is evaluated using multiple metrics.
The best model, Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, achieves high accuracy in classifying text into the 20 newsgroup categories.

## Future Improvements

(1) Experimenting with deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT) for improved classification.

(2) Fine-tuning hyperparameters using grid search.

(3) Exploring topic modeling techniques like LDA.
