# Text Classification & Text Mining on Twenty Newsgroups Dataset

## Overview

This project applies text classification and text mining techniques on the Twenty Newsgroups dataset. The dataset consists of newsgroup posts categorized into 20 different topics, making it a popular benchmark for text analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Features

(1) Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization.

(2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Word frequency analysis, word cloud visualization.

(3) Text Classification: Implementation of various machine learning models such as Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

(4) Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix visualization.
